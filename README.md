# DIF Hackathon Submission

For the November 2023 DIF Hackathon Aviary Tech created a functioning implementation of the [did:btco](https://github.com/ordinalsreserve/did-btco) method.

## Accomplishments:

- Created fully functional [DID registration and resolution implementation](https://github.com/aviarytech/btc-ordinal-dids) for the did:btco method.
- Created a [Universal Resolver Driver](https://github.com/aviarytech/uni-resolver-driver-did-btco) for the did:btco method.
- Simplified the [did:btco method](https://github.com/ordinalsreserve/did-btco) by using new features in Ordinals (reinscription & metadata)
- Added the new driver to the universal resolver.

### DIF Work Items Used:

- DIDLint
- Universal Resolver
- DID Resolution Specification

## Next Steps:

- [] Generate DID Docs using CLI instead of DID Doc [#6](https://github.com/aviarytech/btc-ordinal-dids/issues/6)[#9](https://github.com/aviarytech/btc-ordinal-dids/issues/9)
- [] Create a short form method to save data storage fees [#2](https://github.com/ordinalsreserve/did-btco/issues/2).
- [] Add `equivalentId` property to DID resolution [#11](https://github.com/aviarytech/btc-ordinal-dids/issues/11).
- [] Add block information to DID resolution metadata [#13](https://github.com/aviarytech/btc-ordinal-dids/issues/13)
- [] Query DID at specific date and time [#10](https://github.com/aviarytech/btc-ordinal-dids/issues/10)
